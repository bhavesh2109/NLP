1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
So I was born

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
on the last day

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
of the last year of the '70s.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
(cheering)

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
hip-hop --

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop --

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
and Anita Hill.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,820
(Cheering)

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,820
My parents were radicals --

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
(Laughter)

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
who became,

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
well, grown-ups.

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
My dad facetiously says,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
"We wanted to save the world,

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,820
and instead we just got rich."

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,820
We actually just got "middle class"

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
but you get the picture.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,820
I was raised with a very heavy sense

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,820
of unfinished legacy.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,820
At this ripe old age of 30,

24
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
in this horrible, beautiful time,

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
and I've decided, for me,

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
it's been a real journey and paradox.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
The first paradox

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,820
is that growing up is about rejecting the past

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
and then promptly reclaiming it.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Feminism was the water I grew up in.

32
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
When I was just a little girl,

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
my mom started what is now

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
the longest-running women's film festival in the world.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,820
I was watching very esoteric documentaries

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,820
made by and about women.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
You can see how this had an influence.

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
But she was not the only feminist in the house.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
My dad actually resigned

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,820
from the male-only business club in my hometown

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,820
because he said he would never be part of an organization

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,820
that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,820
(Applause)

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
He's actually here today.

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,820
(Applause)

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
The trick here

48
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
is my brother would become an experimental poet,

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
not a businessman,

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
but the intention was really good.

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,820
(Laughter)

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
even though it was all around me,

54
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
because I associated it with my mom's women's groups,

55
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
none of which had much cachet

57
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
in the hallways of Palmer High School

58
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
where I was trying to be cool at the time.

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
But I suspected there was something really important

60
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
about this whole feminism thing,

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,820
so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves

62
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,820
and picking books off and reading them --

63
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.

64
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,820
I didn't actually claim the feminist label

65
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
until I went to Barnard College

66
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.

67
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."

68
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask,

69
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
was responsible for my feminist click moment?

70
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Fishnet stockings.

71
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I thought they were really hot.

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.

74
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Now I tell you this --

75
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,820
I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
because I think part of the work of feminism

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
that fun do matter.

79
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,820
There are lots of very modern political movements

80
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
that have caught fire in no small part

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
because of cultural hipness.

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?

83
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,820
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
but it looks very different.

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
My mom says, "patriarchy."

86
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
I say, "intersectionality."

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,820
So race, class, gender, ability,

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
all of these things go into our experiences

89
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
of what it means to be a woman.

90
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.

91
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,820
But for me, so is immigration. (Applause)

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
Thank you.

93
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
My mom says, "Protest march."

94
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
I say, "Online organizing."

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
I co-edit, along with a collective

96
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
of other super-smart, amazing women,

97
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,820
a site called Feministing.com.

98
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,820
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
and I tell you this

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
because I think it's really important to see

101
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
that there's a continuum.

102
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version

103
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,820
of consciousness raising.

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
But we also have a straightforward political impact.

105
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Feministing has been able

106
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.

107
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail

108
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
fired from a Big Ten school.

109
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
And one of our biggest successes

110
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa

111
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.

112
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."

113
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
So we're able to pull in the next generation

114
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
in a totally new way.

115
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem."

116
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,

117
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman,

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,

119
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and on and on and on and on."

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
We don't want one hero.

121
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,820
We don't want one icon.

122
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
We don't want one face.

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
We are thousands of women and men across this country

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
doing online writing, community organizing,

125
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
changing institutions from the inside out --

126
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
all continuing the incredible work

127
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
that our mothers and grandmothers started.

128
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
Thank you.

129
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
(Applause)

130
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Which brings me to the second paradox:

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
sobering up about our smallness

132
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
and maintaining faith in our greatness

133
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
all at once.

134
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Many in my generation --

135
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,820
because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education --

136
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
were socialized to believe

137
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,820
that we were special little snowflakes --

138
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
(Laughter)

139
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,820
who were going to go out and save the world.

140
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
These are three words many of us were raised with.

141
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
We walk across graduation stages,

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
high on our overblown expectations,

143
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
and when we float back down to earth,

144
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
we realize we don't know what the heck it means

145
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,820
to actually save the world anyway.

146
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,820
The mainstream media often paints my generation

147
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
as apathetic,

148
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
and I think it's much more accurate

149
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
to say we are deeply overwhelmed.

150
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair --

151
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
an environmental crisis,

152
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
wealth disparity in this country

153
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
unlike we've seen since 1928,

154
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
and globally,

155
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.

156
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.

157
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.

158
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
I experienced this firsthand myself

159
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,820
when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.

160
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,820
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.

161
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
I went out and I worked at a non-profit,

162
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
I went to grad school, I phone-banked,

163
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,820
I protested, I volunteered,

164
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,820
and none of it seemed to matter.

165
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
And on a particularly dark night

166
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
of December of 2004,

167
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
I sat down with my family,

168
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
and I said that I had become very disillusioned.

169
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy --

170
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
of writing a letter

171
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
about everything that was wrong with the world

172
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
and then lighting myself on fire

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
on the White House steps.

174
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
My mom

175
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,

176
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
her eyes really welled with tears,

177
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
and she looked right at me and she said,

178
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,820
"I will not stand

179
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,820
for your desperation."

180
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,820
She said, "You are smarter, more creative

181
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
and more resilient than that."

182
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Which brings me to my third paradox.

183
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly

184
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,820
and being fulfilled by failing really well.

185
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,820
(Laughter)

186
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
(Applause)

187
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,

188
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed

189
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves

190
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
and a servile underestimation of ourselves."

191
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
You may have guessed by now,

192
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
I did not light myself on fire.

193
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,820
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.

194
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,820
I wrote the book I needed to read.

195
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
I wrote a book about eight incredible people

196
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
all over this country

197
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
doing social justice work.

198
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,

199
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,

200
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
who's dedicating her life

201
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
to environmental justice.

202
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I wrote about Emily Apt

203
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system

204
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,820
because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,

205
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
but quickly learned, not only did she not like it,

206
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
but she wasn't really good at it.

207
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.

208
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
So she made a film about the welfare system

209
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
and had a huge impact.

210
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,820
who joined the military so she could afford college.

212
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp

213
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
and went on to co-organize a group

214
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,820
called the Service Women's Action Network.

215
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
What I learned from these people and others

216
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
was that I couldn't judge them

217
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.

218
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems --

219
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,820
the military, congress,

220
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
the education system, etc.

221
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,820
But what they managed to do within those systems

222
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
was be a humanizing force.

223
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
And at the end of the day,

224
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
what could possibly be more important than that?

225
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.

226
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
But how good a failure is it?"

227
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.

228
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
It's to say we operate on two levels.

229
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
On one,

230
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
we really go after changing these broken systems

231
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
of which we find ourselves a part.

232
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
But on the other, we root our self-esteem

233
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day

234
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,820
more kind, more just, etc.

235
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
So when I was a little girl,

236
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
I had a couple of very strange habits.

237
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
One of them was

238
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,

239
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
and I would suck the thumb of my left hand

240
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,820
and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.

241
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
(Laughter)

242
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.

243
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
She was talking about board meetings,

244
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
she was founding peace organizations,

245
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --

246
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
all these daily acts of care and creativity.

247
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
And surely, at three and four years old,

248
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,

249
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.

250
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
The activists I interviewed

251
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,

252
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
which was that they all cited their mothers

253
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
as their most looming and important

254
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
activist influences.

255
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
So often, particularly at a young age,

256
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
we look far afield

257
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
for our models of the meaningful life,

258
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,820
and sometimes they're in our own kitchens,

259
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
talking on the phone, making us dinner,

260
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,820
doing all that keeps the world going around and around.

261
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
My mom and so many women like her

262
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
have taught me that life is not about glory,

263
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
or certainty, or security even.

264
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
It's about embracing the paradox.

265
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,820
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.

266
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
And it's about loving people really well.

267
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
And at the end of the day,

268
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,820
these things make for a lifetime

269
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,820
of challenge and reward.

270
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Thank you.

271
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
(Applause)
